# Access
Accessing already existing datasets touches on issues of licensing and copyright.
* [Data sources: Overview guide](https://guides.smu.edu/data) 

## Activity
* If you have a specific dataset or [database](https://guides.smu.edu/az.php) in mind, we can discuss those.
* If not, we will look at and discuss what data is accessible through JSTOR or HathiTrust. 
* What *data* can you access? What *datasets* can you access? 
* Is it meant to be human readable (individual downloads only) or are you allowed to do bulk downloads?  
* Is the date already assembled into datasets? 
* What restrictions or permissions are already in place? 
* What are you allowed to do with those datasets?
