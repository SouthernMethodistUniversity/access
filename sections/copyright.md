# Copyright

Copy rights are a *collection of rights,* and they vary from [country to country.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) 
The collections of rights are typically as follows:
* Economic
    * Reproductions of the work in various forms, such as printed publications or sound recordings;
    * Distribution of copies of the work;
    * Public performances of the work;
    * Broadcasting or other communications of the work to the public;
    * Translations of the work into other languages; and
    * Adaptations of the work, such as turning a novel into a screenplay.

* Moral 
    * The right to claim authorship of a work (sometimes called the right of paternity or the right of attribution); and
    * The right to object to any distortion or modification of a work, or other derogatory action in relation to a work, which would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation (sometimes called the right of integrity).

Cultural heritage institutions like archives and museums can require that you ask them for permission to re-use or re-publish copyrighted works in their collections, but if they create a scanned reproduction of something that is in the public domain, that scan won’t be copyrightable.

## What is fair use? 
[Fair Use as a doctrine has a long informal tradition, dating back to the 18th century, but its codification only came into effect with the Copyright Act of 1976.](https://www.smu.edu/libraries/fondren/services/copyright/fairuse)

### Measuring fair use: The four factors
* The purpose and character of your use.
* The nature of the copyrighted work.
* The amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and.
* The effect of the use upon the potential market.
