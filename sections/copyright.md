Cultural heritage institutions like archives and museums can require that you ask them for permission to re-use or re-publish copyrighted works in their collections, but if they create a scanned reproduction of something that is in the public domain, that scan won’t be copyrightable.

### Measuring Fair Use: The Four Factors
* the purpose and character of your use.
* the nature of the copyrighted work.
* the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and.
* the effect of the use upon the potential market.
