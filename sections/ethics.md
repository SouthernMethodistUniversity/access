# Ethics
The approach of this discussion is premised on the understanding that there is no simple roadmap for practicing 'good ethics' and, indeed, what constitutes 'good' or 'ethical' for one individual may vary from the next and is often reflective of a scholar's political commitments and personal background.  Nonetheless, we will foreground key ethical questions to ask (and keep asking!) when designing and doing digital projects or digital research, and key concepts to draw upon when thinking through these questions.

We will discuss: specific ethical questions and levels of impact to consider when doing various forms of digital research and using digital tools, including: (1) direct impacts on people through data collection; (2) the politics of knowledge production and categorization; and (3) social, political, and economic impacts of projects or research (drawing from Markham 2016 in [Resources](sections/resources.md));
- Critically consider questions of accessibility and openness, for people of varying (dis)abilities, and depending on people's language fluencies, access to technology and speedy internet, and geo-political location in the world

# What are ethics?

For the purposes of this session, I define ethics as the moral principles that an individual aims to follow in practice to the best of their ability, research, and foresight.

Ethics are not just a list of universal standards that can be found in a research methods textbook, or the entirety of the Institutional Review Board's protocols, or that which is legal under the current political regime where one is located. Ethics are about being caring and sensitive towards the ways in which what an individual does and does not do affects other people, foremost, and perhaps also ecosystems, and trying one's best to not only not cause harm to them but ideally also actively do good (or even take an activist approach!).

Practicing good ethics is in part acting on one's moral instincts, but it is also about stopping to question those instincts, to research histories and effects, and to empathize and communicate with individuals and communities.

## What do we mean by digital projects and research?

Projects or research that engage with the digital—i.e. that examine, use, or create digital tools or platforms.

## Situated ethics

**Situated ethics** refers to the notion that a person's understandings of and commitments to ethics or morality are greatly linked to their own experiences, positionalities, and political orientations, as well as the particular context in which that person is putting such ethics into practice (see Helen Simons and Robin Usher, *Situated Ethics in Educational Research*, 2000). "Situated ethics" draws on Donna Haraway's concept of *Situated Knowledges* (1988), which argues that all ideas, whether in science, the humanities, or personal convictions, are created from and are inherently representative of the conceptualizer's particular situated standpoint.

As Haraway eloquently argues:

> "I would like to insist on the embodied nature of all vision, and so reclaim the sensory system that has been used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere. This is the gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation. This gaze signifies the unmarked positions of Man and White, one of the many nasty tones of the word objectivity to feminist ears in scientific and technological, late industrial, militarized, racist and male dominant societies, that is, here, in the belly of the monster, in the United States in the late 1980s. I would like a doctrine of embodied objectivity  that accommodates paradoxical and critical feminist science projects: feminist objectivity means quite simply situated knowledges." (Donna Haraway, "Situated Knowledges," 1988, page 581)  

Situated ethics thus argues that ethical concerns will vary amongst people, disciplines, projects, tools, and contexts depending on the particular situated perspective of that person, group, or project.  

Thinking through how ethical ideas and practices, or lack thereof, are situated may prompt questions such as: How were computers developed? By whom? Where? Why? As Meredith Broussard argues in *Artificial Unintelligence* (2018), a "particular strain of white, male bias," to which I'd add United States and Euro-centric, runs deep in tech (page 79).  

# Ethics from the standpoint of the institution

We are scholars, so first things first: understanding any institutional compliance requirements you may need to fullfil to be permitted to do your project or research. Note that this section is primarily focused on institutional compliance in the United States, and emphasizes the perspective of social science researchers, who most frequently contend with Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). While humanities researchers often do not have to engage with IRB when working within their discipline, these considerations may also become relevant when creating certain kinds of digital projects.

## Thinking in terms of "levels of impact"

An "impact approach" foregrounds:

> "... the possible or probable impact, rather than the prevention of impact in the first place. It acknowledges that we change the world as we conduct even the smallest of scientific studies, and therefore, we must take some personal responsibility for our methods." ([Annette Markham, "OKCupid data release fiasco: It’s time to rethink ethics education," 2016](http://annettemarkham.com/2016/05/okcupid-data-release-fiasco-its-time-to-rethink-ethics-education/))

> Drawing from Markham (2016), let's focus on three levels of impact:  
1. Direct impacts on people
2. Ramifications of (re)producing categories
3. Social, political and economic effects  

Additionally, this workshop will address the range of impact, or the range of accessibility to your work:  

- to people with disabilities,
- to people in different countries or who speak different languages, and
- in terms of cost and proprietary accessibility.

## Discussion prompt
* Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. Pair up with another person near you and discuss:  

1. In 1 minute each, what is the *purpose* of your project—what does it *aim* to do?
2. In 1 minute each, what is the *design* of your project—*how* will you do this?
3. In relation to each of your projects' purpose and design, what might be some ethical concerns that fall beyond questions of legality or the purview of the IRB?
