# Summary: **What to do before this synchronous session**

## :white_check_mark: **Read one of the following posts before this session.**
Read one of the following instances of how the use of computational technology, machine learning, or AI has led to some unintended consequences:
* Health care risk-prediction algorithm, a major example of tools used on more than 200 million people in the U.S., demonstrated racial bias—because it relied on a faulty metric for determining need. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/racial-bias-found-in-a-major-health-care-risk-algorithm/ 

* Amazon’s recruiting engine was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way. - https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/10/amazon-hiring-ai-gender-bias-recruiting-engine

* COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions),  a commercial algorithmically-driven tool use to forecast recidivism, found that black defendants were far more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly judged to be at a higher risk of recidivism. - https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm

Respond to the following in the thread in Slack:
1.	What is the responsibility of developers, researchers, or those implementing these technologies?
2.	Was this outcome just an inevitability of the technology being applied to this data? 
3.	How does might this apply to your use of technology for scholarship, research, or teaching?

Questions
* These reading get at issues raised throughout this Institute
* How much responsibility do these researchers have for the outcome of their research? Or for the ways in which their datasets are used? 
* * Do these raise new questions for you about the datasets you are thinking about creating?
* * Do these raise new questions for you about the datasets you are thinking about using?-->
