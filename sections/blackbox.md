# Closed systems and Black Boxes 
When corporations, journalists, governmental entities, NGOs, non-profits, researchers keep their data sets and processes hidden, what issues can this raise around ethics and access? 
* If they don't keep their data sets hidden, can that also raise ethical issues? 
* How important is it to consult with disciplinary experts? Community members? 
* How does what your community incentivize encourage certain behaviors. 

We discussed some of this in our [Intro session](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/intro/blob/master/sections/how.md).
* "This past April, Tech Insider talked to experts in the fields of clinical pathology and laboratory medicine, microfluidics, and biomedical engineering to try to piece together an answer [on how the Theranos Edision machine was supposed to work]. No one could figure it out conclusively, because as Dr. David Koch, president of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and a professor at Emory University, said then, "It may be wonderful [or] it may bomb, but I really can't be more definitive because there's nothing to really look at, to read, to react to."[What we know about how Theranos' 'revolutionary' technology works](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-theranos-revolutionary-technology-works-2015-10) & [What Exactly Was The Theranos Edison Machine Supposed To Do?](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/224904/theranos-edison-machine-blood-test-technology-explained)


* "Broken world thinking shifts us from the question, “How did they make that?” to the more subtle question, “How do they keep it running?” Extending this broken world thinking to the realm of the digital humanities forces us to reckon with black boxes before they become the wreckage of the past... But what if we took black boxes not as the endpoint of history, but as an inception point? What if the digital humanities understood black boxes — both literal and metaphorical black boxes — as a site for future-looking inquiries instead of a way to reconstruct the past?"

* "...a provocation to reflect upon research approaches and methods themselves whose normative ontologies may (re)produce dynamics of power, inequity, and othering. Many taken-for-granted methodologies have their origins in, for example, colonial attitudes and practices. Digital tools and approaches (indeed professional paradigms) are more often extractive or, by their codifying nature, limit ‘authorised’ types of knowledge and interpretation. Might we reconfigure such methods for transformative ends or seek alternatives?... oral history (at its core in the feminist and social justice tradition) as an example of method that traverses both feminist DH and CHS and with which, we suggest, it is conceptually allied.

## Unintended consequences

### Red teams 
"Rumman also recommends several organizational mechanisms to support better governance approaches to AI ethics: most importantly, being aware of who has the power to make & influence decisions over digital projects. Interdisciplinary approaches are critical to success, but often difficult to enact in practice. She points to the emergent mechanisms within cybersecurity as a particular success: using ‘red teams’ with many different specialisms to identify and address problems. Second, having a process for critical conversations to take place is key. This can be in the format of an ombudsman office whose function is to independently represent the interests of various stakeholders, a review board, or an open-door/town hall policy. But Rumman says for real change to work, a no-blame culture is essential: consider medical ethics review boards, or flight safety, where the focus is on limiting future damage through open and transparent conversations about what went wrong, rather than on identifying & punishing bad actors." - [Critical Literacy for AI Governance Modeling: Growing Digital Ethics in Practice](https://leadingedgeforum.com/insights/critical-literacy-for-ai-governance-modeling-growing-digital-ethics-in-practice/)

### Retraction 
"When the paper’s authors finally called for its retraction, they admitted that their study couldn’t make any claims about race and fatal shootings at the hands of police. “The mistake we made was drawing inferences about the broader population of civilians who interact with police rather than restricting our conclusions to the population of civilians who were fatally shot by the police,” they wrote." - [Tech Firms Hire 'Red Teams.'
