"Smarting from the Cambridge Analytica debacle in 2018, Facebook promised a research initiative to give academics access to its data. I lead one of a dozen research groups that were granted access in February to a large data set, which is still less than was promised, after more than a year of delays. Our project aimed to determine whether disinformation campaigns have a measurable effect on polls. But the data provided are nearly useless for answering this and many other research questions, and are far inferior to what Facebook gives private companies"
