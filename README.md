# Digital projects and research 

We have been discussing different aspects and stages of digital scholarship projects. In this session we will be discussing issues related to obtaining and using data sources for your project. 
* In accessing or creating data sets, there can be both legal (copyright and licensing) ethical issues. 
* We will be discussing:
    * Copyright and licensing as it relates to accessing already existing datasets 
    * Accessibility and access
    * As well as the related topics of ethics, consent and power in the creation or repurposing of already existing data sets.
    * * We are refferring back to our conversation about preconditions for success.  

## Process for DHRI
* We will be sharing the links to a Github Repository for each session in Slack before each synchronous session. You can also get to them from the [Curriculum page](https://southernmethodistuniversity.github.io/home/curriculum.html).
* This is the first year where DHRI has been planned to have both asynchronous and synchronous components. Here is how we have organized the content.  
   * As you are reading, we you will see *four* categories of content:
      * Asynchronous Content presentation (unmarked). Please read ahead of time.
      * Asynchronous Activity (indicated by green check mark :white_check_mark:). Please make sure you read this content before a session. Some questions have corresponding Slack channels or discussion, others are just marked so you are thinking about them beforehand as they are topics we will be discussing in the synchronous session.  
      * Synchronous Content presentation (indicated by a yellow dot :yellow_circle:). This indicates a page that has content we will go over together; you do not need to engage with this content ahead of time. 
      * Synchronous Activity (unmarked). We will do these activities together in the synchronous sessions.
* As you read each repository please put questions/comments in the Slack channel. 
* If text appears blue in a repository, that just means it is a hyperlink.
    * These repositories are structured in such a way that they will direct our conversations during the institute, but also so that you can return to them later to review the material. 

## Required before this session (8/10/21)
* All content is :white_check_mark: marked throughout; it is also all gathered on [this page](sections/async.md).
