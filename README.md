# Digital Projects and Research 

We have been discussing different aspects and stages of digital scholarship projects.  In this session we will be discussing issues related to obtaining and using data sources for your project. 
* In accessing or creating data sets, there are ethical issues and legal (copyright and licensing issues) issues. 
We will be discussing:
* copyright and licensing as it relates to accessing already existing datasets 
* Accessibility and access
* as well as related topics of ethics, consent and power in the creation or repurposing of already existing data sets
