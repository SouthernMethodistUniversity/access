# Digital Projects and Research 

We have been discussing different aspects and stages of digital scholarship projects. 

In this session we will be discussing copyright, licensing and accessing already existing datasets or other materials. 

If you are lucky enough to find already existing resources or dates sets you may not be able to sue them in the way you would like. we will discuss some of the challenges you may face in this session. 

In accessing or creating data sets, there may be ethical issues and/or legal (copyright and licensing issues) issues.

We discussed [ethics in this session](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/ethics)
