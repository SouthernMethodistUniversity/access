# Digital Projects and Research 


We have been discussing different aspects and stages of digital scholarship projects. 

## Broadly, you may have goals around: 
### Sources (data or other materials you want to analyze)
* Digital Humanities and Data
* Acquiring, Cleaning, and Creating Data
* Identify the differences between unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.
* Distinguish between different file types, their definitions, and applications.
* Apply intellectual property rights to the downloading and sharing of data.
* Practice different ways of downloading or creating data.
### Processing (how can these resources be analyzed or prepared for analysis) 
* The Command Line (Python)
* Working with Tools (openrefine, Voyant)
### Presentation (how do you want to share your sources and your findings). 


Your goals and your constraints (limitations of time, money, expertise, etc.) will dictate your choices (topic, tools, programming, etc.)

* In this example from Programming historian, you can see how lessons fall into broard phases or categories.
